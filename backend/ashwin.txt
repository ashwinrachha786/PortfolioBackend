About me:

I am a Master's student majoring in Computer Science at Virginia Tech. I have a passion for building, scaling, maintaining and perusing about intelligent systems that have sprung from the fields of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and principles of Software Engineering with their presence in real-world settings. 

My most recent experience was a wonderful internship experience at Outreach Corporation where I was responsible for building a template engine project that could ease the process of Deploying NLP based models online for Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers. During this experience I learned how to build and configure a complex Inference Service Solution (NVIDIA Triton Inference Server) for deploying Model Binaries for BERT, ROBERTA and DistilBERT in their ONNX flavor. I also wrote a Golang Based Microservice which would be used to communicate with the configured server and would server prediction results in real-time. Finally to test the working of the project I wrote tests in CircleCI configs and dockerized the inference solution as well as the microservice into a container and deployed it online via Kubernetes manifests. Being in a close knit environment with great leaders and programmers was the best highlight of my internship. This experience evolved my thinking about designing and deploying systems at scale . It also goes without saying that I had an opportunity to add a lot of technologies to my belt ranging from Golang, CircleCI, Kubernetes, Docker, Bash scripting, Python scripting and Software Engineering tools such as Git, Github, JIRA, Confluence etc. 

I love writing about and elucidating Machine Learning and Deep learning concepts and code, it sort of acts as a mental note to myself and as a result I blog regularly @ https://ashwinrachha.github.io/blogpost/ and https://medium.com/@ashwin_rachha/ . I am a Kaggle Notebooks experts and enjoy writing code related to Data Science, NLP and CV competitions. Please checkout my kaggle profile @ https://www.kaggle.com/ashwinrachha1. Alternatively I love solving Data Structures and Algorithms related problems and frequenty blog about them. Checkout my Leetcode profile @ https://leetcode.com/ashwin_rachha/

I am open for Full time opportunities in Machine Learning and or Software Development starting in the summer of 2023. Please feel free to reach out to me regarding any opportunity or for collaborations or just for the sake of reaching out :D.

My Cover Letter:

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am a graduate student pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science (MS Thesis)
degree from Virginia Tech with a concentration in coursework and thesis in Machine Learning
and Explainable AI. I am looking for opportunities in the field of Machine Learning with a focus of
extracting key insights from data and operationalize ML based applications and also delve into
the flexibility in discipline of work and excitement to jump in new areas of technology. I'm highly
interested in building software solutions for professionals turning billions of data points into
meaningful answers.
My undergraduate and current graduate coursework was analogous to an evolutionary
computing model - in order to achieve a proficiency in Data Science it was essential to obtain a set
of skills in a progressive fashion.Through taking courses related to Machine Learning and Data
Science and doing various competitions on Kaggle and becoming a Kaggle Notebooks expert I
burrowed myself into the fundamentals of ML and AI. After gaining enough basic knowledge I
went on to intern Outreach Corporation as a Machine Learning Engineering Intern where I was
responsible for for developing a template engine project to help Data Scientists and Machine
Learning Engineers at Outreach to use templates to deploy any NLP model online inorder for
them to avoid writing redundant boiler plate code. I delivered an Online Inference Solution with a
gRPC based Microservice in Golang serving NLP based models viz. BERT, ROBERTA and
DISTILBERT for topic detection, question detection, action analysis and sentiment analysis that
reduced the online inference deployment time from 6-7 days to simply 2 hours.
Before that I worked at Mindbowser Inc where I was working on a Facial Expression Recognition
application based on Deep Transfer Learning that was intended to record customer behaviour
during meetings/sales pitches for improving CRM by detecting and classifying facial expressions
into one of the seven fundamental categories of emotions. I also wrote a script to store the
meeting metadata in a mongoDB database.
In my graduate coursework I took the courses related to Data Science viz, Data Analytics,
Introduction To Deep Learning, Natural language Processing Information Storage and
Extraction and Software Engineering wherin I have worked on and solve various problems in
DS related to coupled with how they can be implemented and deployed in the industry. In my
graduate thesis I am working in the domain of Explainable AI in with Dr. Mohammed Seyam of
Virginia Tech. I Intend to study how the output of Data based models can be explained or
interpreted to reinforce trust between smallholder farmers and the underlying intelligent systems
. I have also produced two research papers in the similar field. My love for writing and interest in
Data Science constantly inspires me to elucidate ML concepts which I compile from time to time
on Medium and my own Blog.
In all of the qualities mentioned above and in my Resume and the history in my Cover Letter, I
believe that my willingness to learn new things and dedication to find a solution is what sets me
apart from my peers. I love working and collaborating in a team with different diverse opinions
and have always welcomed constructive criticism. Infact much of the knowledge and experience I
have, have been the result of listening to the advice of people better than me.I am curious and
adventurous in my journey to understanding Machine Learning which is what wakes me up in the
morning with a jolt and I am ready to take the next challenge in my industrial experience with an
opportunity to work for your esteemed organization for which I shall be utterly grateful.
Sincerely,
Ashwin Rachha.

### Education

- **How did you fare in high school mathematics, physical sciences and computing? Which were your strengths and which most enjoyable? How did you rank, competitively, in these subjects?**
    - Back when I was growing up in India, from class 1st to class 6th I was not that great in Mathematics. In class 6th I was almost going to fail in the class. It was at that time that I was sent to a more competitive school where students were hungry and passionate about learning new concepts and excel at school. That kind of competitive spirit and eagerness to learn gave them and along with them, me, excitement about learning new concepts. So from class 6th to class 12th I fared excellent in high school mathematics and physics. I was not yet introduced to computing in my High School it was not until I started my bachelors degree did I get to delve my hands into Computers. I had also secured a top 2000 position in my State Level aptitude examination which tested Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry skills in High School i.e class 12th (right before university admissions)
- **What sort of high school student were you? What would your high school peers remember you for, if we asked them?**
    - Because I was shifting schools a lot, I had a lot of changes in my personality throughout my schooling. In the later years of my high school I was a pretty introvert yet welcoming person. Going through a personal skin tragedy myself, a big highlight about my personality was being empathetic about someone else’s potential reservations or inhibitions and trying to comfort them in my own way. So I became a very good listener and bonded with people whenever they needed to be heard or needed to listen to something inspiration. I was always throwing inspirational quotes and stuff to say at them, which I would like to believe made them feed slightly better about themselves, if not entirely.
- **In languages and the arts at high school, what were your strongest subjects and how did you rank in those among your school peers?**
    - I was fanatic about English Literature and loved reading classics and writing some poetry of my own in my high school. I was a big fan of William Wordsworth, Oscar Wilde, William Blake, Lord Byron and also a big short story writer’s fan ranging from Anton Chekhov to Leo Tolstoy to Guy de Maupassant. I believed because I was an introvert and could not open myself up to the the world, I can connect very well with the world of literature and hence put a lot of focus over there. Some of my early works can be found on this website https://ashwinrachha.wordpress.com/ .
    
    **********************************************************************************************************************************************************************PS . I had written that blog when I was 15 so a lot of time has passed since then. My writing has surely matured.********************************************************************************************************************************************************************** 
    
- **Please outline some high school achievements considered exceptional by peers and staff members.**
    - I had won an inter-school poetry competition which was quite a prestigious achievement for me. The competition was held between prestigious schools from all over the state and I had won the first prize for my poem “Umbra” which I had written myself which talked about racism in the orient. It was the first time when I truly felt important as being lauded by staff and peers meant quite a lot as initially nobody had any idea about my writings and my passion for writing.
- **Which degree and university did you choose, and why?**
    - I chose to study Computer Science during university. I was interested in AI and Machine learning right from that time. My interest in computer science and artificial intelligence sprung from a number of sources. My original interest was incited by a novel innovation in chess, IBM’s deep blue, a chess engine that defeated the world champion of chess. The fact that machines could be automated to not only take decisions like a human being
    but to dare to go beyond the extent of the ordinary norms of the generational technology captivated me. I found having a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science indispensable for my future aspirations and hence took admission at the Pune Institute of Computer Technology. Pune Institute of Computer Technology is one of the most renowned colleges in my hometown i.e Pune.
    - After getting comprehensive experience with working in the intersection of Software Development, Machine Learning Engineering and Data Science Development, I found having a Master’s degree indispensable for my future growth. I was always interested in research and found out that Virginia Tech offered some of the best courses and research tracks in the country and I applied to the university. I was one of the fortunate 50 something people to get an admit and I started my educational experience here in the US. My thesis right now is in Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Education and I am loving every aspect of my graduate education here at Virginia Tech.
- **What did you enjoy most about your time at university?**
    - I thoroughly enjoyed the collaborative and hands-on learning environment at Virginia Tech. The coursework was challenging, but working on group projects and applying what I learned to real-world projects allowed me to deepen my understanding of computer science. I also appreciated the support from my professors and peers, and the opportunities to engage in cutting-edge research. There was also an inclusive environment for international students at Virginia Tech which I was a part of so it did not seem like I am not a part of this, it very much felt like home.
- **Which university courses did you perform best at? How did you rank in your degree?**
    - I performed very well in NLP based courses in my University which were Natural Language Processing and Information Storage and Retrieval. I got an A in both the subjects and our team also got the best project prize for the project “Virginia Tech Search Engine” in which we had employed a search engine on Virginia Tech pages using an Inverted Index data structure.
- **Outside of class, what were your interests and where did you spend your time?**
    - I spent most of my free time playing chess. I am very much passionate about the game and I although I do not have a FIDE rating my unofficial chess rating is around 2000 which is almost equivalent to that of a National Master. I love playing small blitz (3 min) games online with opponents and study the intricacies of the game. I also follow chess championships and study players (Ofcourse my all time favorites being Magnus Carlsen and Vishy Anand)
- **What did you achieve at university that you consider exceptional?**
    - I recently got my Paper “Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Education : Current Trends, Challenges and Opportunities” in IEEE SouthEastCon a conference where leading researchers are going to present their work in a variety of fields related to Computer Science in Orlando Florida in April. After an Intensive 1.5 of work in the field I was able to publish and present a framework related to explainability for black box models deployed in the field of CS education. This took a lot of time and patience on my behalf.
    - I would also like to point out another achievement that I would like say is exceptional (personally). During the first half of my first semester it was exceptionally difficult to make connections and find jobs in this country. Because of this I had a mental health situation that I am sure most of us have suffered some or the other time. Upon introspection I found out there are some flaws in me that need to be addressed i.e connecting with people, being personalble, presenting myself and my skills to the world (thats why I started blogging : https://medium.com/@ashwin_rachha    and https://ashwinrachha.github.io/blogpost/) and I finally got a very nice opportunity to intern at Outreach Corporation in Seattle as a Machine Learning Engineer.

### **Career development**

- **Please describe any experience as a professional software engineer, working on commercial products.**
    - During my time at Outreach, I had the opportunity to work as a Machine Learning Engineering Intern, where I gained hands-on experience in developing online inference solutions. I was part of a dynamic team i.e the Data Science Team and was responsible for delivering solutions that could serve NLP based models for various tasks like topic detection, question detection, sentiment analysis, and action analysis. I utilized my skills in programming languages like Python and bash scripts to instantiate NLP models in their ONNX flavor on the NVIDIA Triton Inference server.  I was also involved in writing Python pipelines for data ingestion, preprocessing, tokenization, prediction and postprocessing of text data. Additionally, I had to learn Go for this internship as most of Outreach’s codebase is in Golang and I wrote a Golang microservice communicate with the models instantiated on the server using docker compose. I also had the experience of working with tools and frameworks like Docker, Kubernetes, CircleCI, Pytorch, and Tensorflow, among others. I was proud to have deployed the application online via Kubernetes manifests and was responsible for writing tests for the application and inference services. This was my first commercial experience with developing container based technology and using container orchestration platform. I also templatized the project to be generically applied by data scientists, reducing the time for development to deployment from several days to just a couple of hours. Overall, working at Outreach was a great learning experience for me and provided me with a wealth of knowledge in the field of machine learning and software development
- **Please describe any experience as a software engineer working on internal company projects rather than commercial products.**
    - I had this kind of opportunity to work on an internal project at Mindbowser Inc. During my time at Mindbowser, I had the opportunity to work as a Software Engineering Intern in the field of Machine Learning. I was able to gain hands-on experience in developing a Facial Expression Recognition application that aimed to detect and classify expressions during meetings. This project was a challenging but rewarding experience as it allowed me to learn and apply various cutting-edge technologies. Since it was a POC based project and the company did not have any other data scientist to work with me, I had to make a lot of decisions and that taught me the decisions you take now may severely affect you in the future. I had the chance to train a proof of concept Convolutional Neural Network model using transfer learning, and I was able to achieve an accuracy of 73% on the validation set. This project involved using PyTorch and MongoDB, and I was able to package the code in a Python based executable. I also had the opportunity to integrate the code with a Flask application and Docker, making it easier to deploy the application as a web application. Overall, my experience at Mindbowser was a great opportunity for me to grow both personally and professionally. I was able to work on a real-life project and develop my skills in various aspects of software development, including machine learning, database integration, and application deployment. This experience has given me the confidence and ability to tackle complex projects in the future. But that being said there are many things I could have done differently. Now that I have gained some comprehensive experience in the field of ML I can say for sure that I could have made tremendous changes to the way I did things back then in 2019.
- **Describe your skill in your preferred development language, and how you attained it.**
    - I have given a lot of time to hone my Deep Learning skills particularly working in the development of Language Models in Natural Language Processing. Associating my previous As per my resume, I have hands-on experience in NLP (Natural Language Processing) with Python.

It was a demanding task as the code was interdependent on multiple systems and any small change would result in unexpected outcomes. The dataset that the model was trained on was also biased and there was no other additional data stores to get the relevant dataset from. So I ended up creating a custom dataset for myself and wrote unit tests for the prediction on my custom dataset for Facial Recognition i.e detection as well as Expression Recognition. I didn't give up and went on to find a reliable way to test the code. I started by breaking down the code into smaller, manageable parts and then created a testing plan for each part. I also made use of automated testing tools, which allowed me to test the code efficiently and quickly. Moreover, I worked closely with my team and sought feedback from them, which helped me to identify the areas that needed more attention. In the end, my persistence and determination paid off as I was able to develop a robust testing mechanism that ensured the code was reliable and of high quality.
